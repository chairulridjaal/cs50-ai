# CS50 AI Projects â€“ Personal Journal
Welcome to my CS50 Intro to AI with Python project repository! This is a collection of my personal solutions and learning journey through the course.

# Purpose
This repository is intended as a personal journal of my progress, and I'm sharing it for educational purposes. I hope that anyone viewing this repository can gain insight into how the code works, the thought process behind it, and perhaps use it as inspiration for their own learning.

# Please Don't Copy the Code
While I'm happy to share my solutions, I encourage you not to copy the code directly. Doing so would defeat the purpose of learning! Instead:

1. Try solving the problems yourself first.
2. Use my solutions as a reference to understand the logic and structure.
3. Learn from the way I approached the problems and see how you can adapt your own solutions.

# Learn First, Then Code
CS50 AI is an amazing course that provides hands-on experience with foundational concepts in artificial intelligence, such as:
1. Search algorithms
2. Machine learning
3. Knowledge representation
4. Natural language processing

Take the time to experiment with the code and understand each concept before writing your own implementation.

# Disclaimer
This repository is for educational purposes only. It's here to help others learn and not for cheating or academic dishonesty. Make sure to adhere to the CS50 Academic Honesty policy when using any reference material.
